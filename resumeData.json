        "description":"In my four years as an undergraduate student at UCR I was able to build invaluable relationships and gain unique experiences not just through academia but also through clubs and outside projects. Most notably I enjoyed building a prototype of the ASUCR voting website. Although it did not end up getting used, I learned valuable lessons in team work and the importance of security and code reviews. I also joined the intramural basketball league for a quarter and lost brutally almost every game but still had a good time. Despite the extra activities, I was still a focused student and graduated Magna Cum Laude with a 3.78 GPA."
